When you delete a file in a branch and then merge that branch into the main branch in Git, here's what happens:

1. **File Deletion in Feature Branch**:
   - You create a new branch (let's call it `feature_branch`) from the main branch.
   - In `feature_branch`, you delete a file (e.g., `file.txt`) and commit the change.

2. **Merge into Main Branch**:
   - After making the changes in `feature_branch`, you switch back to the main branch.
   - You initiate the merge process, bringing the changes from `feature_branch` into the main branch.

3. **Result of the Merge**:
   - If the file (`file.txt`) was not modified in the main branch after the creation of `feature_branch`, Git will successfully merge the changes.
   - In this case, `file.txt` will be deleted in the main branch as well.

4. **Conflict Resolution (if applicable)**:
   - If `file.txt` was modified in the main branch after the creation of `feature_branch`, Git will detect a conflict.
   - You will need to manually resolve the conflict, which could involve keeping the changes in the main branch, keeping the changes in `feature_branch`, or merging them together.

5. **Commit the Merge**:
   - After resolving any conflicts, you will commit the merge. This creates a new commit that represents the merge of `feature_branch` into the main branch.

6. **Resulting State**:
   - After the successful merge, the main branch will now reflect the changes made in `feature_branch`, including the deletion of `file.txt`.

In summary, when you delete a file in a branch and then merge that branch into another branch, Git will propagate the deletion to the merged branch, provided the file wasn't modified in the target branch after the creation of the feature branch. If there are conflicts, you'll need to manually resolve them during the merge process.

Always remember to commit your changes before merging to ensure that your repository is in a clean state before performing any complex operations like merging.
